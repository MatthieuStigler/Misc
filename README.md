# Misc: collection of small R scripts

This is a collection of small R scripts that I use internally, and which might be useful to others:

- Shannon and Rao's quadratic entropy with standardization
- R script to check overlap of polygons
- Interpolating values, similar to gstat but reusing the distance matrix
- Code to get hansen data with rgee
- etc
